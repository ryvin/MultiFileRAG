In accordance with the Debt Col lection Improvement Act (Pub.L.  04-134), if the fees remain \nunpaid after 180 days and no repayment arrangements have been made, we will refer the debt to the U.S. Department of Treasury for collection. \nDebt collection procedures used by U.S. Department of Treasury may include referral of the debt to private collection agencies, reporting of the debt \nto credit bureaus, garnishment of  private wages and administrative offset of the debt by reducing, or withholding eligible federal payments (e.g., tax \nrefunds, social security payments, federal retirement, etc.) by the amount of your debt, including any interest penalties or other costs incurred. In \naddition, non -payment of passport fees may result in the invalidation of your passport. An invalidated passport cannot be used for travel.\nIf you send us a check, it will be converted into an electronic funds transfer (EFT). This means we will  copy your check and use the account \ninformation on it to electronically debit your account for the amount of the check. The debit from your account will usually occur within 24 hours and \nwill be shown on your regular account statement. You will not receive your original check back.

In \\naddition, non -payment of passport fees may result in the invalidation of your passport. An invalidated passport cannot be used for travel.\\nIf you send us a check, it will be converted into an electronic funds transfer (EFT).
