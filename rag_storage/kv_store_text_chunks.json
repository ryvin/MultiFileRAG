Unlike the U.S. passport book, the U.S. passport card is valid only for entry at land\nborder crossings and sea ports of entry when traveling from Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Bermuda.\nThe maximum number of letters provided for your given name (first and middle) on the U.S. passport card is 24 characters. If both your given names\nare more than 24 characters, you must shorten one of your given names you list on item #1 on page 1 of 2.\nBoth the passport book and card are U.S. passports. They reflect the bearer's identity and nationality, and they are subject to existing passport laws\nand regulations. U.S. passports are only issued to U.S. citizens or non-citizen U.S. nationals.\nPassport service fees are established by law and regulation (see 22 U.S.C. 214, 22 C.F.R. 22.1, and 22 C.F.R. 51.50 -56) and are collected at the \ntime you apply for the passport service.\nIf we fail to receive full payment of the applicable fees (for example, if your check is returned for any reason or you dispute a passport fee charge to \nyour credit card), the U.S. Department of State will take action to collect the delinquent fees from you under 22 C.F.R. Part 34 and the Federal Claims \nCollection Standards (see 31 C.F.R. Parts 900 -904). In accordance with the Debt Col lection Improvement Act (Pub.L.  04-134), if the fees remain \nunpaid after 180 days and no repayment arrangements have been made, we will refer the debt to the U.S. Department of Treasury for collection. \nDebt collection procedures used by U.S. Department of Treasury may include referral of the debt to private collection agencies, reporting of the debt \nto credit bureaus, garnishment of  private wages and administrative offset of the debt by reducing, or withholding eligible federal payments (e.g., tax \nrefunds, social security payments, federal retirement, etc.) by the amount of your debt, including any interest penalties or other costs incurred. In \naddition, non -payment of passport fees may result in the invalidation of your passport. An invalidated passport cannot be used for travel.\nIf you send us a check, it will be converted into an electronic funds transfer (EFT). This means we will  copy your check and use the account \ninformation on it to electronically debit your account for the amount of the check. The debit from your account will usually occur within 24 hours and \nwill be shown on your regular account statement. You will not receive your original check back. We will destroy your original check",
